# Ocaml Interpreter

This is a Silly Basic language interpreter in Ocaml, results are similar to that of the Scheme Interper. Any results
which would produce a complex value in Scheme should produce nan in the version of the interpreter due to the 
difference in the Ocaml and Scheme languages.

This is a project for Professor Wesley Mackey's CMPS 112 at UCSC.
